# Singly Linked List:

<table>
<tr><td>

⏺️ A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) contains:

  - Data: The value stored in the node.

  - Next: A pointer/reference to the next node in the list.

⏺️ The last node’s next pointer is set to NULL to indicate the end of the list.

<br> 🟠 Basic Operations:

```html

- Insertion: Add a node at the beginning, end, or a specific position.

- Deletion: Remove a node from the beginning, end, or a specific position.

- Traversal: Visit each node to access or display its value.

```

<br> 🟠 Advantages:

```html

• Dynamic size: Can grow or shrink as needed.

• Efficient insertions and deletions: No shifting of elements like arrays.

```

<br> 🟠 Applications:

```html

• Dynamic memory allocation.

• Implementation of stacks, queues, and other abstract data types.

• Undo functionality in text editors.
