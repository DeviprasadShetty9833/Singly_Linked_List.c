# Singly Linked List:

▶️ A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) contains:

  - Data: The value stored in the node.

  - Next: A pointer/reference to the next node in the list.

▶️ The last node’s next pointer is set to NULL to indicate the end of the list.

🟠 Basic Operations:

```html

   - Insertion: Add a node at the beginning, end, or a specific position.

   - Deletion: Remove a node from the beginning, end, or a specific position.

   - Traversal: Visit each node to access or display its value.

```

🟠 Advantages:

```html

• Dynamic size: Can grow or shrink as needed.

• Efficient insertions and deletions: No shifting of elements like arrays.

```

🟠 Applications:

```html

• Dynamic memory allocation.

• Implementation of stacks, queues, and other abstract data types.

• Undo functionality in text editors.

```
