# Singly_Linked_List:

<table>
<tr><td>

⏺️ A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) contains:

  - Data: The value stored in the node.

  - Next: A pointer/reference to the next node in the list.

⏺️ The last node’s next pointer is set to NULL to indicate the end of the list.

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand 🔻</summary>

<br> 🟠 Basic Operations:

```html

- Insertion: Add a node at the beginning, end, or a specific position.

- Deletion: Remove a node from the beginning, end, or a specific position.

- Traversal: Visit each node to access or display its value.

```

<br> 🟠 Advantages:

```html

• Dynamic size: Can grow or shrink as needed.

• Efficient insertions and deletions: No shifting of elements like arrays.

```

<br> 🟠 Applications:

```html

• Dynamic memory allocation.

• Implementation of stacks, queues, and other abstract data types.

• Undo functionality in text editors.

# 🔎 Explanation of Code: 


<br> ![1.](https://img.shields.io/badge/_1]_-Header_Files-000080?style=for-the-badge&logo=C&logoColor=white)   

*Code:*

```html
#include <stdio.h>   // For input/output functions like printf and scanf
#include <stdlib.h>  // For malloc and free functions

```

<br> ![2.](https://img.shields.io/badge/_2]_-Node_Structure-000080?style=for-the-badge&logo=C&logoColor=white)   

*Code:*

```html
typedef struct Node {
    int data;              // Holds the value
    struct Node *next;     // Pointer to the next node
} Node;

```

*Explanation:*

> - typedef allows you to create an alias for a data type. In this case, it enables you to use Node instead of writing struct Node every time.
> - Node is the name of the structure.
> - data is used to store the value contained in the Node.
> - next is a pointer of type struct Node, which is used to point to the next Node in the linked list, thus creating the chain-like structure.

*In Plain English:*

> This is a structure (called Node) that contains:  an integer data, and a pointer next that links to the next node in the list. Also, because of typedef, you can just say Node instead of struct Node.”

<br> ![3.](https://img.shields.io/badge/_3]_-Create_a_Node-000080?style=for-the-badge&logo=C&logoColor=white)   

*Code:*

```html

Node* createNode(int data) {
    Node *newNode = (Node*)malloc(sizeof(Node));  // Allocate memory

    newNode->data = data;                         // Set the value
    newNode->next = NULL;                         // Initially points to nothing

    return newNode;                               // Return the new node
}

```

*Explanation:*

> - createNode is function that returns a pointer to a Node.
> - newNode is a pointer to a Node.
> -  malloc calculates the size in bytes needed to store a Node Structure and allocates memory from the heap(dynamic memory) and returns void pointer.
> - (Node*) before malloc converts (typecasting) the generic void pointer into a Node pointer.
> - int data is stored in newNode's data and newNode's next pointer points to NULL i.e does not point to anything.

*In Plain English:*

> "I made a new node for you. I saved your number in it. I made sure it doesn't point to any other node yet. Now I’m giving it to you so you can put it into your list."

<br> ![4.](https://img.shields.io/badge/_4]_-Insert_At_Beginning-000080?style=for-the-badge&logo=C&logoColor=white)   

*Code:*

```html

void insertAtBeginning(Node **head, int data) {
    Node *newNode = createNode(data);                 // Create node

    newNode->next = *head;                            // Point new node to current head
    *head = newNode;                                  // Move head to new node

    printf("%d inserted at the beginning\n", data);
}

```

*Explanation:*

> - Node **head is a pointer to the head pointer of list. It allows modifying the actual head.
> - Link newNode to initial node pointed by head. 
> - Link head pointer to point new node, thus newNode becomes initial node.

*Example:*

```html

Position:        1             2   
List: head→[20 | next]→[30 | next]→NULL
Insert: [10 | next]→NULL at position 1 i.e before 20.

Step 1:

  [10 | next] ← newNode
         ↓ 
  head→[20 | next]→[30 | next]→NULL

Step 2:

  [10 | next] ← newNode
    ↑    ↓ 
  head→[20 | next]→[30 | next]→NULL
 
Step 3:

  head→[10 | next]→[20 | next]→[30 | next]→NULL

```

*In Plain English:*

> I made a new node for you. I saved your number in it. Then, I'll link it to the current first node (if there is one). Now I’ll point this head to this new node — boom, it's leading the list!"

<br> ![5.](https://img.shields.io/badge/_5]_-Insert_At_End-000080?style=for-the-badge&logo=C&logoColor=white)   

*Code:*

```html

void insertAtEnd(Node **head, int data) {
    Node *newNode = createNode(data);
    
    if (*head == NULL) {
        *head = newNode;
        printf("%d inserted at the end\n", data);
        return;
    }
    
    Node *temp = *head;
    while (temp->next != NULL)
        temp = temp->next;                     // Move to the last node
    temp->next = newNode;                      // Link new node at the end

    printf("%d inserted at the end\n", data);
}

```

<br> ![6.](https://img.shields.io/badge/_6]_-Insert_At_Position-000080?style=for-the-badge&logo=C&logoColor=white)   

*Code:*

```html

void insertAtPosition(Node **head, int data, int pos) {
    if (pos < 1) { 
        printf("Invalid position!\n");
        return;
    }

    if (pos == 1) {
        insertAtBeginning(head, data);
        return;
    }

    Node *newNode = createNode(data);  // Create newNode

    Node *temp = *head;
    for (int i = 1; i < pos - 1 && temp != NULL; i++)
        temp = temp->next;
    if (temp == NULL) {
        printf("Position out of bounds!\n");
        return;
    }

    newNode->next = temp->next;
    temp->next = newNode;

    printf("%d inserted at position %d\n", data, pos);
}

```

*Explanation:*

> - Traverse the list until you reach two nodes before the desired insertion position.
> - At this point, the pointer temp is at the node just before the target position.
> - Link newNode's next to next node of temp.
> - temp's next points to newNode.

*Example:*

```html

Position:          1           2            3            4
List:   head→[10 | next]→[20 | next]→[40 | next]→[50 | next]→NULL
Insert:  [30 | next]→NULL at position 3 i.e before 40.
                                
Step 1:

head→[10 | next]→[20 | next]→[40 | next]→[50 | next]→NULL
       ↑          
      temp 
 
Step 2: After for loop

head→[10 | next]→[20 | next]→[40 | next]→[50 | next]→NULL
                    ↑
                   temp  

Step 3:
              newNode → [30 | next]
                                ↓ 
head→[10 | next]→[20 | next]→[40 | next]→[50 | next]→NULL
                    ↑
                   temp  

Step 4:
              newNode → [30 | next]
                          ↑      ↓ 
head→[10 | next]→[20 | next]  [40 | next]→[50 | next]→NULL
                    ↑
                   temp  

Step 5:

head→[10 | next]→[20 | next]→[30 | next]→[40 | next]→[50 | next]→NULL
                    ↑            ↑
                   temp       newNode




```


*In Plain English:*

> First, if the position is 1, I’ll just insert it at the beginning — easy peasy. Otherwise, I’ll walk through the list node by node until I reach the place just before where the new node should go. If I reach the end before finding that spot, I’ll shout ‘out of bounds!’. But if I’m in the right place, I’ll: create the new node, link it to the next node, and adjust the current node to point to this new one. Boom! The new node is now exactly where you asked for."
